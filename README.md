math-eval - A math expression evaluator in PHP
===

`version 1.0`

**math-eval** is a lighweight and fast library to evaluate a mathematical expressions without the need to use PHP's `eval()`


&nbsp;


TL;DR
===
Example: *Two raised to the power of three plus the sine of* ***Ï€*** *divided by eight factorial, all multiplied by ten to the power of three.*

**in your project:**

```PHP
require_once( "matheval.php" );

use function \Kalei\Matheval\matheval;

$expression = "fooBAR^3 + sin(pi/8!) * 10e3";

$parameters = [ "fooBAR" => 2 ];

$result = matheval( $expression,
                    $parameters,
                    $error );
						
if( $result !== false )
{
    printf("%.6f", $number);  // ==> 8.779165
}
else
{
    echo "$error\n;
}
```


**in the terminal:**

```
$ php matheval.php '2^3 + sin(pi/8!) * 10e3'
8.7791648438519
```

Expressions syntax reference
===

**Operators**

`+` plus

`-` minus

`*` multiplication

`/` division

`^` exponentiation (*right associative as it should be*)

`!` factorial (using Gamma function)

&nbsp;


**Available functions**

`sin(r)`  sine

`cos(r)`  cosine

`tan(r)`  tangent

`asin(n)` arcsin

`acos(n)` arccos

`atan(n)` arctan

`fact(n)` factorial of `n`. Equivalent to `n!`.

`exp(n)` base **e** exponential function of `n`. Equivalent to `e^n`.

`pow(b, n)` `b` to the power of `n`. Equivalent to `b^n`.

`log(n)` natural logarithm of `n` (with base **e**)

`log(b, n)` logarithm of `n` with base `b`

`max(n1, n2, n3, ...)` maximum of one or more numbers

`min(n1, n2, n3, ...)` minimum of one or more numbers

`average(n1, n2, ...)` or `avg(n1, ...)` average of one or more numbers

&nbsp;

**Numbers can be expressed as follows:**

`0.123`  or  `.123`  or  `12.3E-2`  etc..

&nbsp;

**Recognized constants:**

`e`  euler number

`pi` **Pi**

&nbsp;

**Parentheses:**

Use round brackets `(` `)` to nest expressions.


&nbsp;

**Operators precedence:**

Highest to lowest:

`(` `)`

`!`

`^`

`-` unary minus, right associative

`*` `/`

`+` `-`

Unary minus has **lower** precedence than exponentiation (like in Python); for example:

`- 3 ^ 2` is evaluated as `- (3  ^ 2 )` = `-9`

However it is advisable to use parentheses when the expression is abiguous (ex. JS Chrome raises an arror for `-3**2`.

&nbsp;

**Whitespace:**

Whitespace, tabs and newlines are ignored.

&nbsp;

**Errors:**

If the expression is malformed or it is correct but would result in math operations not allowed (division by zero) or operations that would generate a complex number or too big number (overflow) then `false` is returned and a explicative error message is returned in `$error`.
